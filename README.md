This project follows that "Playing Atari..." and this https://github.com/yenchenlin/DeepLearningFlappyBird

Actually I just use the network in this skiergame.

I thought you must do better than me,so I uploaded this project.

And I hope you can help me to train it,Thank you!

Because my computer can't run it over than 25000 steps.It always be 'out of memory' and killed.

if you can help me resolve that will be better.
Or if you can improve this project,I will give you a BIG grateful!  

How to run it?
With python3,tensorflow,pygame,opencv,I think you should have them
